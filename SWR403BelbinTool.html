Your strength lies in imagination and lateral thinking. Be mindful of staying connected to the group process so ideas move into completion.",
    RI: "You bring energy and fresh perspective into collaborative sessions. You often open new directions or reframe creative blocks. Your curiosity prevents stagnation. Be aware that sustained focus is sometimes needed to carry ideas through once initial excitement fades.",
    CO: "You help the group stay aligned and purposeful. You may clarify direction, summarise decisions and ensure everyone understands the goal. Your strength lies in oversight and balance. Try to ensure you also contribute creatively, not just organisationally.",
    SH: "You bring drive and urgency to the creative process. When momentum drops, you push things forward and challenge the group to raise its standard. This energises collaboration. Balancing directness with sensitivity will strengthen your impact.",
    ME: "You provide thoughtful analysis and objective judgement. You step back to assess whether ideas truly serve the whole piece. Your strength lies in critical listening and decision-making. Be mindful that excessive caution can slow experimentation.",
    TW: "You support the collaborative atmosphere and maintain psychological safety. You notice when others disengage and help bring them back in. Your strength lies in relational awareness. Ensure your own creative voice remains present.",
    IMP: "You translate ideas into structured musical reality. You help move work from concept to form and create dependable frameworks. Your reliability strengthens collaboration. Stay open to flexibility when experimentation is needed.",
    CF: "You refine and polish. You are attentive to detail and committed to high standards before something is declared finished. This protects quality. Be mindful of perfectionism slowing the creative flow."
